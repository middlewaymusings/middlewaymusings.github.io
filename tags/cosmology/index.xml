In recent years, the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has unveiled discoveries that have shaken the foundations of our cosmic understanding. Among its most startling findings are fully formed, massive galaxies dating back to just 300-500 million years after the supposed Big Bangâ€”galaxies that, according to conventional Big Bang cosmology, simply shouldn&amp;rsquo;t exist yet.
