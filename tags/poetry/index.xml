Preface This poem was written during my second Traditional Rain Retreat. It is a reflection meant to generate the mind of &amp;ldquo;renunciation&amp;rdquo;, although the correct word to convey the meaning of the sanskrit words niḥsaraṇa or niryāṇa would be &amp;ldquo;emergence&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;going forth&amp;rdquo;.</description></item></channel></rss>
