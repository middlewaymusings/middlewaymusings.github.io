Preface This poem was written during the teaching of Nyingtik Yabshi in May 2024. It is a reflection on attachment to the concerns of this life (ཚེ་འདི་), a fundamental obstacle on the Buddhist path.
In the Kadampa tradition, it is said that if one is attached to this life, one is not a true Dharma practitioner. This poem explores the various ways this attachment manifests—in our relationships with wealth, comfort, reputation, praise, and influence—and how these attachments become obstacles to genuine practice.</description></item><item><title>Reflections on Going Forth | རབ་བྱུང་ཞིག་གི་བསམ་གཞིགས།</title><link>https://middlewaymusings.com/posts/poem-on-going-forth/</link><pubDate>Mon, 11 Sep 2023 13:44:10 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://middlewaymusings.com/posts/poem-on-going-forth/</guid><description>Having decided to embark on the spiritual path, Siddhartha cuts his hair, removes his royal garments, and puts on rag robes.

Preface This poem was written during my second Traditional Rain Retreat. It is a reflection meant to generate the mind of &amp;ldquo;renunciation&amp;rdquo;, although the correct word to convey the meaning of the sanskrit words niḥsaraṇa or niryāṇa would be &amp;ldquo;emergence&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;going forth&amp;rdquo;.</description></item></channel></rss>
