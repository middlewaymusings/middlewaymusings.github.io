Introduction It has become all too common these days to refer to Buddhist monasteries (by which I mean established communities of monks or nuns that maintain traditional Vinaya observance) by their cultural flair or the doctrinal views they follow. We may call some monasteries &amp;ldquo;Tibetan&amp;rdquo;, or &amp;ldquo;Zen&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;Theravāda&amp;rdquo;, or even &amp;ldquo;Mahāyāna&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;Hīnayāna&amp;rdquo; (i.e. Śrāvakayāna). While it may seem to make sense, these labels create unnecessary barriers between monastics who are actually much closer spiritual siblings than it may appear.</description></item></channel></rss>
